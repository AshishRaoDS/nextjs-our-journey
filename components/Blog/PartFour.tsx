      <h3>Part 4: The one where everything makes sense</h3>
      <p>
        Very honestly, putting every effort to not sound cheesy, I wish I could precisely put how I actually feel.
        It is a feeling to live. It makes no fucking sense. Yet, I'll try as we go on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was crazy, the first time I travelled to Pune. It felt like a wish that you have which you hope for to come true but there's a sense of
        certainty that the wish you had is just wishful thinking and all along you knew you were asking for something that was never going
        to happen. Huh, that is exactly how I was feeling. I was sitting there at the Bangalore airport and I saw a Go First flight to Pune get
        cancelled in front of my eyes. That added to my feeling of what I started, wasn't going to go as I have imagined it to go as.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were shit scared when you met me at that airport. You had just committed the blunder of sharing your cab ride details with your mom &#x1F602;.
        The journey to our restaurant had a sense of unfamiliarity to it. We both needed time to get accustomed to each other. And by the time our lunch was done,
        I was super comfortable but I clearly saw that you needed time. Aaaah that cab ride. First time being able to sit next to you without any fog in my head. Our comfort started to build
        from there on. From weirdness to we started growing towards good friends. To great friends. That coffee and walk in that college was exactly what we needed to fill that
        void. And once it was finally filled, I could see that we saw each other in the same light as we saw each other through our rectangulars for so long.
        The feeling that was so familiar when at distance finally felt familiar standing beside each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        I absolutely had the time of my life spending four days there. Travelled back home with all the clarity, all the answers and a few certainties. One of them being, I had
        turned an honest sincere girl into a serial liar &#x1F602;. And that, I am given something that I better fully appreciate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a relationship that started as long distance. Is it harder before you meet or after? I think we both agree that it is easier after you meet, as now
        we both have the sense of how it feels to be with the other person, but sometimes this very sense acts a catalyst for that slowly growing pain to shoot right up.
        A quote which I came across in a show which we use so often that -
        <q>Often, misery is wasted on the miserable.</q><span> </span>
        Makes sense doesn't it? People who are miserable in our sense of misery, waste it away. It is this misery that is an indicator of value that
        you still hold for the other person. Fucking crazy that I've learnt to sometimes enjoy that horrible pain too. A good kind of missing that we
        manage so gracefully. Well, at least this is what we say to each other and convince each other to appreciate what seems to be unbearable.
        It does feel unfair to miss someone to that degree but I see how lucky I am to be able to actually do so.
        Something that is worth losing time at light speed while at the same time you feel everything is at a stand still.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never used to believe in long distance relationship. I always thought it was too complicated to handle. Too much effort and
        absolutely impractical. It was almost as if you were setting up yourself to fail. And I still think that long distance isn't a piece
        of cake. You can't easily pull it off. It takes a lot of effort. The difference I've found is, who you are with can make the difference between
        heaven and hell. You can be with the nicest person but you need someone who can be practical at times. You need someone whom you can trust 100%
        and who trusts you back the same exact amount. Even a percent of imbalance in that regard and it all falls apart. As I said, it takes effort.
        Some days a lot more. You need someone worth putting that effort for. A kind of effort that still seems less and someone who equally puts in effort for you.
        Where the other person doesn't make you feel even for a second that you are the only one trying.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the sounds too much to ask from someone. Not everyone can or wants to do it. Most people won't ever get to experience it. It's a kind of thing that you hear
        happened to a friend of yours who knows someone who knows the person that this happened to. But it's a one sided story. We don't know what misery behind the scenes those people
        actually hold. It has happened to me. It is happening to me. It is as blissful as it sounds. What seems like too much to someone, what feels like a loss just because we don't it now( something like meeting
        everyday), is a loss and too much effort and too much of a headache, if you take it out of the context of what that person provides for you. Not what that person does for you,
        that plays a part as I mentioned, in how you feel relative to your effort but what that person provides. What that person adds to your calm and to your joy.
        How that person's presence in life makes you look at the world in a different way. When being in relationship is more than just taking each others time.
        When that person is so bat shit crazy that I of all people, am educated about importance, and value emotions hold for someone and how one should acknowledge it.
        That is what you do for me. That is how insane you are. That is why all of this makes sense. YOU MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always believed, sayings and emotions like these belonged in an exaggerated poem, novel, song..., on love.
        Maybe, it is not exaggerated. Maybe, it does exist. Maybe I'm delusional as fuck. Maybe, just maybe life has given me
        something at a time when I can see its value and thoroughly acknowledge it and I'm doing everything I can to do so. 10 months of us together
        signifies how far we've come and that spinner right beside it, was added to show we aren't done. Making room for each other, supporting each other,
        constructively criticizing each other... we have a lot more to do. Thank you for everything so far.

      <p>Happy Birthday Tanaya :)</p>
